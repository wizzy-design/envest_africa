### Envest Africa

Envest Africa is a project born out of a failed hackathon. My team didn't pass the first stage of the hackathon so everyone did the natural thing and abandoned it. 
I saw it as an opportunity to put to practice what i have learnt so far about ReactJS.
This project helped me further understand:
* usage of props
* state management
* use of styled-components in styling
* use of components
among several other things. My confidence has been boosted a little 😁.

Here's a twitter thread where i updated my weekly progress when building Envest: https://twitter.com/WisdomOchei/status/1640435381525966848?s=20

Now, back to taking Dev Ed's react courses 🏃🏽‍♂️💨
`Note: I haven't made the site responsive yet. Working on that`
